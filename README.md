# **Bookssite**

## **Description**
Bookssite is a Django-based backend API designed to allow users to manage their book collections. Users can:
- Sign up, verify their accounts via email, log in, and log out.
- Update their profile information, including first name, last name, and bio.
- Add books to the database and organize them into shelves like "Want to Read," "Reading," "Read," and "Favourite."
- Rate books when shelving them as "Read" or "Favourite."
- Search for books by title or author.
- Change or reset their passwords securely.

This is a backend-only project, and all API endpoints are documented using Swagger for easy testing and integration with any frontend framework.
